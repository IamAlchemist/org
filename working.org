* DONE 线性回归的输入输出到底是什么，什么是hypothsis function，什么是cost function
* DONE contour plot and minize cost function
* DONE what is gradient descent aglorithm? why call it batch gradient descent?
* DONE what is the difference betwwen classific problem and linear regression problem?
the hypothesis can't be linear regression
the hypothesis should be logistic regression which 0 <= h(x) <= 1
* DONE what is sigmoid function, and what is it for? 
* <2017-12-23 Sat>
* DONE for logistic regression, how to interpret the hypothesis output? what is the output?
h(x) = P(y = 1 | x; theta)
* DONE what is dicision boundary? what's is for?
* DONE what id the cost function of logistic regression? why linear regression cost function does not work for logistic regression?
* DONE what is feature scaling? what is it for?
* DONE what is advanced gradient libraries?
